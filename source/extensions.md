# Extensions

Extensions are standards used with PALS lattice files that are specific to a single simulation program.
This section documents extensions to aid the User in identifying extension usage in lattice files
and in directing the User to detailed extension documentation. 

Program developers are encouraged to [contribute extension documentation](#s:contribute).
