# This is a PALS example of beamline with three identical FODO cells.
#
# This example demonstrates:
# - definition of individual elements
# - definition of a short line (fodo_cell) that:
#   - uses pre-defined elements (drift1, quad1)
#   - inherits & changes an element (quad2)
#   - reuses elements with the same name (drift1)
# - definition of a FODO channel that:
#   - repeats a line (fodo_cell) three times
#
PALS:
  version: null  # later, we will put the version of the PALS standard here
